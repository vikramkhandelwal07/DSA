    "### Problem: Lemonade Change\n",
    "\n",
    "At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5. You start with no change.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task:\n",
    "Given an integer array `bills`, where `bills[i]` is the bill the ith customer pays, return `true` if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach:\n",
    "1. Track the number of $5, $10, and $20 bills using a dictionary.\n",
    "2. For each bill:\n",
    "   - If the bill is $5, add it to the change pool.\n",
    "   - If the bill is $10, check if you have a $5 bill to give as change.\n",
    "   - If the bill is $20, try to give a $10 and $5 as change, otherwise give three $5 bills.\n",
    "3. Return `true` if you can give change to all customers, otherwise return `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "**Input:** `[5, 5, 5, 10, 20]`  \n",
    "**Output:** `true`  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "- From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills.\n",
    "- From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.\n",
    "- From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.\n",
    "Since all customers got correct change, the output is `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "**Input:** `[5, 5, 10, 10, 20]`  \n",
    "**Output:** `false`  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "- From the first two customers, we collect two $5 bills.\n",
    "- For the next two customers, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.\n",
    "- For the last customer, we cannot give the change of $15 because we only have two $10 bills.\n",
    "Thus, the output is `false`.\n"
